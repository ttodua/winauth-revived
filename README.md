(Read the <a href="https://github.com/winauth/winauth">original WinAuth's README</a>)

Unfortunately, original WinAuth's development has been archived, without leaving a way to contact author & suggest last updates. So, we've voluntarily forked it (actually from <a href="https://github.com/Florastamine/winauth">Florastamine 2020-09-01</a> update) and on top of it added some essential features:

- Search-box to quickly filter the desired sites from list.
- Option to drag &drop QR-image onto the Add-Authenticator window.
- Option to auto-copy the one-time code if the searched result is single.
- Option to auto-close app  (to save an extra click) when you copy the code..
- Standalone .exe file is being produced by Costura.Fody.
- Fixed "Auto-Update" interval option being erased on next re-open.


(One issue still persists which we couldn't fix - when having tons of sites, WinAuth takes a while to open on startup).
